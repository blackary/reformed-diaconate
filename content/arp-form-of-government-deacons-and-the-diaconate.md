__DESCRIPTION AND QUALIFICATIONS OF A DEACON__

__5.1__ The office of deacon as set forth in the Scriptures is
ordinary and perpetual in the Church. The office of
deacon is one of sympathy and service after the example
of Christ.

__5.2__ To this office should be chosen individuals who are
faithful and diligent Christians of good character, of
honest repute, exemplary life, brotherly love,
sympathetic nature, and sound judgment, who are
qualified under the standards recorded in Scripture.

__5.3__ A deacon shall be a member in good standing of the
congregation, actively sharing in the worship and
service of the Church and giving particular emphasis to
the duties of his office.

__5.4__ Unless otherwise determined by the Session, the
Diaconate shall be chosen from male members of that
congregation. The Session of each congregation shall
determine whether women can serve as deacons in their
own particular congregation. In either case, the Church
shall not neglect the raising up of qualified men to serve
in this position.

__PURPOSE OF THE DIACONATE__

__5.5__ It shall be responsible for the congregation’s ministry to
those in material need or distress and all such things as
can be covered by the term “mercy ministry.” The
needs of those who are within the congregation shall be
given first priority, and then those needs outside the
congregation.

__5.6__ It shall also encourage practice of total stewardship
among the members of the congregation, encouraging
tithing in particular, a general spirit of liberality and
hospitality towards their fellow saints as well as the
world, and helping them to see that their possessions are
a trust to keep before the Lord.

__5.7__ It shall plan, in collaboration with the Session, the causes
toward which the offerings of the congregation shall be
directed; devise effective methods for securing and
receiving these offerings; secure and receive special
offerings as directed by the Session and the higher
courts of the Church; and see that all offerings are
properly recorded and distributed.

__5.8__ It shall have the care of the general property of the
congregation, both real and personal. In matters
requiring extraordinary expenditure for acquisition,
construction, or alteration of Church property, consent
of the congregation is required.

__5.9__ The congregation shall seek to call those to be deacons
who collectively demonstrate the gifts and calling
necessary for such ministry.

__ORGANIZATION OF THE DIACONATE__

__5.10__ The deacons of a particular congregation shall be
organized as a board, the Diaconate, of which the pastor
and associate pastor(s) shall be advisory members, and
of which the congregational treasurer shall be an
advisory member when not otherwise a member thereof.
The Diaconate shall elect a chairman and a secretary
from among its own number. The secretary shall keep a
record of the Diaconate’s proceedings and shall submit
its minutes to the Session in a timely manner.

__5.11__ The congregational treasurer, who is entrusted with the
regular offerings of the congregation, shall be
responsible to the oversight of the Diaconate. A monthly
financial report of the congregational treasurer shall be
included in the minutes of the diaconate. An outside
entity, someone not directly connected to the
congregation, shall conduct a financial review to ensure
full accuracy and disclosure of church finances. Such a
review shall be paid out of the church’s funds, made
part of the Sessional record, and made available to any
member who wishes to view it. Such a review shall be
conducted no less frequently than every third year.

__PROCEDURE OF THE DIACONATE__

__5.12__ The Diaconate shall normally hold one regular meeting
 each month (meeting no fewer than nine times per year).

__5.13__ The chairman shall call a meeting of the Diaconate at
any time he deems necessary. He shall call a meeting
upon the request of either two deacons or the Session.
Adequate notice of such meetings shall be given to all
members of the Diaconate as well as to the pastor(s) of
the church.

__5.14__ The Diaconate of each congregation shall determine the
number of its members necessary for a quorum, but it
shall not be less than one half for a stated meeting or one
quarter for a called meeting.

__5.15__ Only members who are personally present are entitled to
vote.

__5.16__ Each meeting of the Diaconate shall be opened and
closed with prayer.

__RELATIONSHIP TO THE SESSION__

__5.17__ In the discharge of its duties, the Diaconate is a board of,
 and under the supervision and authority of the Session.
 The congregational budget and other important financial
decisions require the approval of the Session prior to
 presentation to the congregation.

__5.18__ The Session shall have the authority to void or amend
 any action of the Diaconate, or return it for further
consideration.

__5.19__ The Diaconate and the Session shall have a joint
 meeting annually in conjunction with the budget
 process and at other times as necessary.

__5.20__ The joint meetings can take no official action, but the
Session and Diaconate shall act separately on matters
committed to the care of each respectively.

__5.21__ In a congregation in which it is impractical for any
reason to secure deacons, the duties of that office shall
devolve upon the elders.
