#### Excerpt

> As the Board of Deacons at the Orthodox Presbyterian Church of Franklin Square, New York, we have struggled for many years with the application of biblical truth to diaconal needs. We have felt the need to systematize a number of principles in order to avoid "shooting from the hip" in these ever increasing instances of financial assistance.
