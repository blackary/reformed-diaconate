#### Excerpt

> Our charity towards the membership should be such that it makes the world outside her walls jealous for the faith, hope, and charity within. Thus, our deeds toward one another should and will promote our missionary enterprise among the lod and dying of the world.

------

> Do not be come discouraged with little or slow results. Continue your labor. Be faithful in small things. Remember that you are not accountable for the timing of the harvest, but for the labor. When tempted to stop short, when uncertain how you can keep your heart and hand open to the needy, hear these words from R. A. Webb: "But when 1 see that the Lord Jesus identifies himself with them, then as long as I have any intered in Him, and any love for Him, they have claims upon my affections for His sake" (Webb, 113).
