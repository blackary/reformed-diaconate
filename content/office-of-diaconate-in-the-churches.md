#### Excerpt

> Since the Scriptures do not provide any other concrete revelation about the general task of the deacons, we conclude that the Word of God teaches that the mandate for the diaconate contains these ingredients as normative:
>
> 1. The office of deacon is a particularized and specialized expression of the office of all believers.
> 2. In their task and calling the deacons demonstrate, model, and teach the Saviour's love for His own.
> 3. The primary objective of the particular duties and tasks of the deacons is to facilitate, promote and develop the communion of the saints.
> 4. The application of the diaconal mandate varies, depending on circumstances and need.
