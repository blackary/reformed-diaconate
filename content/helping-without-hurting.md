#### Excerpts

> Good intentions are not enough. If we misdiagnose the causes of their poverty or treat their symptoms rather than their underlying problems, we can do considerable harm to materially poor people in the very process of trying to help them. We have to get the diagnosis right.

-------------

> If your church does not take the time to develop a philosophy and policy document, your benevolence ministry will lack the compass it needs to keep moving in the right direction.
