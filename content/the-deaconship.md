#### Excerpt

> That indeed, is a sadly defedive state of the church where there are no poor, there mud be something verv deficient in its zeal and aggressiveness, if amidd the multitudes of poor around us, and mingling with us, there are none in the church itself.

-------

> No church is bound to elect men to an office, however important it may be, unless her Lord has given her men of suitable qualifications, and this is the case in very many of our smaller churches. A sufficient number of individuals cannot be obtained to fill the separate offices of elder and deacon; and in such cases it becomes neces- sary to have the duties of both offices discharged by the same individuals.
