#### Excerpt

> It is the deacon who best demonstrates the mercy and service of Christ which the elders teach. It
is the deacon who thus fills out the Gospel which the elders proclaim. It is the deacon who best
reminds us that power in the Church is not to be like power in the world, because true power is
first and foremost the power to serve. And thus it is the Gospel which compels us to ordain
deacons in the Church so that Christ, our “table-server,” may be seen in all His fullness. We
ordain deacons to office so that service is given its proper place of honor next to teaching. That
Word and Deed may stand together. We ordain deacons because of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
who came not to be served but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many.
