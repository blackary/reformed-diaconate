#### Excerpt

> Such being, undoubtedly the principles of Presbyterianism the world over, with regard to this officer, how is it that in these United States, the practice of Presbyterianism has allowed the Deacon almost every where to expire, from sheer idleness;â€”his business having been taken from him and put into the hands of a committee appointed by the State Legislature!

> We have finished all that we designed in this article; which was, to prove that by the Constitution of the Presbyterian Church, the Dea- cons are the proper officers to manage all the temporalities of the Church. We belong to the strict construction party. If the Con- stitution is wrong, let it be regularly and formally altered ; but do not let us sneer at, and trample upon any part of that instrument which we have vowed to support entire.
