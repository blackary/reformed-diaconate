#### Excerpt

> The Church, therefore, which shuts up the channel of diaconal ministration must expect to be dwarfed in the development of experimental religion.

------

> More humble and less conspicuous their office may be than that of the elder; but it is not the less divinely warranted, nor is it unilluminated by the splendor of a glorious example. It is a striking fact that the Lord Jesus, in his sojourn on earth, did not occupy the outward seat of the rulerâ€”he condescended to appear as a prisoner at the bar of the eldership of his own visible Church.
