#### Quote

> If he really wants to know what is going on in a family, he must come with more daring questions than is normally the case on social visits. He is after all a deacon and he comes not to satisfy his own curiosity but to give a tangible form to Christ's mercy. Needless to say he must overcome his diffidence. All this, of course, should be done with tact.
